1. Be careful with var, let and const
2. Remove all unusable strings
3. In order to document blocks use this guide: https://react-styleguidist.js.org/docs/documenting.html
at least description of component and properties
in description put some relevant explanation of logic
4. DRY - don't repeat yourself
5. Check if property exists
6. Think about testability
7. Boolean variables should start with "is", "has" or "should"
8. Let's make a convention that "somethig_id" will be with '_', not "somethingId"
9. Each component should export with "export default withStyles(styles) (ClassName)"
10. Use only classes inside components, no functions
11. Delete all unnecessary console.logs or at least comment them
12. All onClick and onChange methods should start with "handle"
